Setting up federation in a devstack environment.

1. Install dependency for SAML authentication module.

The python module dm.xmlsec.binding is used by the SAML module in the federated code for handling signatures on the requests. 

It can be downloaded from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dm.xmlsec.binding/1.0b3

2. Modify the stackrc script with the correct keystone repository:
	The URL is https://github.com/kwss/keystone.git
	The latest branch is kent-federated-april

3. Modify the libs/keystone script so that the following line:
	cp -p $KEYSTONE_DIR/etc/keystone.conf.sample $KEYSTONE_CONF
specifies the example config file provided alongside these instructions

4. Modify the example config file to point to your request signing key if SAML Identity providers will be used, this is specified in the following section of the config file:

	[federated]
	requestSigningKey = /Users/kwss2/test/keystone/cert/privkey.pem
	SPName = KeystoneClientSecure
